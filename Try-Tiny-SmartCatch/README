Try-Tiny-SmartCatch

Lightweight Perl module for powerful exceptions handling.

Provides set of functions (by default):
 * try
 * catch_when
 * catch_default
 * then
 * finally 

Also you can request to import "throw" function (currently it is an alias
for "die", but more explicit):
use Try::Tiny::Extended qw/:all/;

Try::Tiny::SmartCatch give you the same posibilities as Try::Tiny, but 
also allow you to catch only certain types of exceptions.
Additionally change a little it's syntax to use explicit sub blocks.
